    </string>
    <string name="help_rules_answer2">
        If the start field is occupied, you have to make it free as soon as possible.
        </string>
    <string name="help_rules_answer3">
        Are no more figures on the home field and a six was rolled all other figures can be used.
        Also the startfield has not to be free.
        </string>
    <string name="help_rules_answer4">
        If the target field of a figure is occupied by an opponent figure, the opponent figure will be beaten and send back to the home field.
        </string>
    <string name="help_rules_answer5">
        If the target field of a figure is occupied by another figure of the same player, the turn is not allowed.
        Therefore another figure will be chosen or the turn will be finished without moving a figure.
        </string>

        It is the choice of the recent player which allowed figure he wants to move. The dice number cannot be spreaded on more than one figure.
        </string>
    <string name="help_rules_answer7">
        In the 4 endfields of each player there exists 2 special rules.
        First: It is not allowed to jump over other figures in the endfield.
        Second: You can only roll dice once if a figure is on the endfield but not in the goal position.
